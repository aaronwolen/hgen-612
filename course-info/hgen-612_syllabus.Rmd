## Course Description
This course builds upon the material introduced in the prerequisite (HGEN 611/OVPR 611) by providing instruction on advanced techniques for working with data and producing highly reproducible data products. The learning path focuses on the fundamentals of both machine learning and the creation of production ready web applications as two highly marketable skills for future data scientists. Project based assignments culminate in students creating their own applications that take advantage of tidymodel principles to automate machine learning workflows, visually communicate knowledge with interactive graphics, and the use of Git and OSF for project management. The guiding principle of the course is that the these products of research should be open and accessible to all members of a project team for maximum impact. This course will continue the use of the statistical programming language R with a focus on advanced tidyverse functions for data wrangling and statistical model development.  

## Prerequisite
HGEN/OVPR 611 Data Science 1 or Instuctor permission.  

## Textbook
All required reading material will be posted on the class OSF page. There is no required textbook. However, *R for Data Science* (Wickham & Grolemund) is an excellent general reference.  
 
## Grading
Grading will be based upon class attendance and participation. Students are required to attend all 1.5 hour lectures. This amounts to at least 15 hours of instruction for a 1 credit course. Only 1 absence (excused or non-excused) will be allowed. A total of 10 points will be deducted from the final grade for each class not attended under the required amount. No additional excused absences will be granted so plan accordingly.  

## Student Responsibilities

Students are required to bring their laptop to each class and be prepared to follow along with practical data examples. 


## ReproducibiliTea
This is a journal club sponsored by the VCU Data Science Lab and VCU Libraries with the ambitious goal of fixing science (or at least to start a conversation about a few lingering issues). Students are required to attend at least one meeting before 2020-04-30. Be sure to read the journal article beforehand. And yes, tea will be provided (when we are in-person again). Students are required to attend at least one ReproducibiliTea session. Official ReproducibiliTea meetings occur monthly on ~~the second Tuesday at 2pm in Biotech I (Rm 3029, Suite 300)~~. As a result, this class is only required for those who cannot attend those monthly meetings.
